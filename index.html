<I>Kill All Kings began as a radio show during the first summer of covid-19, bringing together the sounds that kept us going through isolation: a hybrid compilation of feminist folk horror, village voice, hard techno, spoken word and pop across distances and decades.
<br>Moving into programming artist moving image, we hold to our motivation of bringing new audiences to the work of artists whose work addresses the evolving worlds we live between with sincerity, humour and care.

    <p><i>Kill All Kings presents a screening of artist video that veers and ascends, challenging normative conceptions of the weird, the grotesque and the paranormal. Bringing together local and international artists, there is a particular focus on the use of sound as a driving force for storytelling: a phone call, an orchestral motif, techno-electronica beat, a pop song, birdsong and village voice.

The current ruling Hindu Nationalist party, the BJP, has been accused of encouraging a slew of violent acts against religious minorities, in part by the passing of bills that threaten the citizenship of those very Demographics.

                                            <BR>  <br><I>GPT3</I> is an ongoing video piece filmed at local teenage hangouts at Linn Park Cemetery in Glasgow over the past year; intermixed with footage of tech destruction, Hellraiser quotes, early video synthesizer tests, found Satanic Panic VHS tapes and broken Y2K cameras.

                                              <br>The first part, GRAVEN IMAGE, encompasses questions that were posed to the Open AI (or neural-network-powered language model gpt30) on what its ‘intuitions’ are about human consciousness. The resulting trapped and disembodied voice recounts the ‘answers’ it gave through remnants of the Cemetery’s shifting and trashed debris. The concluding part, WE CAME, offers up for sacrifice an artifice of pixelated queer doom; here a sick voice unfolds a childhood campfire tale of night visitations. A story that was found, archived and then anonymously deleted on Reddit in 2020.

                                              <br><I>GPT3</i> is placed as a moving image work that is fragmented digital dust screen, an abyssal diary of artificial laments to past bookmarked regions, haunted esoteric tech futures and queer cosmic pessimism.

                                  The small monitor contains a poem I pieced together drawing from a selection of Iraqi poets who write about concepts of exile, displacement, struggles of war, and dictatorship, and what it means to no longer belong to or reside in one’s nation and place of birth. This recitation re-appropriates and contextualizes Iraqi poetry in the form of a collage by using symbolism as a form of expression. The use of symbolic language is commonly found in Iraqi poetry as it demonstrates censorship under dictatorship regimes.

                                      AYAM YALDO is a Montréal/Tiohtiá:ke based artist and recent graduate from Concordia University in the department of Intermedia. Working in a wide range of media including performance, video, sound and sculpture, her work explores narratives that shift between the personal and the political, the past and present, reality and myth. Yaldo’s current research is concerned with the formation of identity and subjectivity, and how these take shape in relation to grand historical narratives, the European tradition of archeology, artifacts, and her personal experience of war and displacement from the Middle East as a child. Focusing on the body, identity and image, Yaldo explores concepts of world building through reconstruction, transformation and ephemerality, in relation to forms of displacement.

                              <BR>  <br>Sextra Curricular Activity is an experimental narrative that examines power, deviance, failure & desire through the lens of the absurd and surreal.

                      Storied depictions make way for ruptures- both celebratory and critical- debunking outmoded societal structures regarding race, class, gender and sexuality. Sound and vision simultaneously destabilize and ground the viewer as a way to enjoy the journey of transgressions of social mores. Stereotypes are reclaimed by a cast of characters that embrace the very biases that place them in the margins, allowing a plunge into alternate pasts, presents & futures that disregard power structures and embrace the authentic self.

                        <BR>  <br><I>enn modeuz​is</I> a film about the act of stitching and working with our hands. When I am sewing, I am stitching.

                          <br>I am beading.

                          <br>I am learning how to quill.

                          <br>I am nurturing those around me.

                          <br>I am caring for my relations from the past and caring for those that will come to be.

                          <br>It is understanding old ways of knowing.

                          <br>Creating from tangible touch is a way of visiting and learning from others. It is understanding yourself and what you inherently already know.

                          <br>This film features family, their hands are present both physically and through their art. Much of the imagery in this film comes from beadwork from my maternal and paternal lineage. ​enn modeuz​includes skin stitching, harvesting quills, and sewing. All of these materials are in relation to adornment and by extension, our bodies. To wear these hand stitched items is to wear our identities. In times where the handmade is overlooked and traditions are seen as forgotten, taking the time to connect with our customs is a part of our revival.

                            <br>12 minutes

                            <br><BR><I>Rite of Return</i> is a moving image work that reflects on Marianne Hirsch’s generational return and post-memory introduced in Rites of Return whilst extending The Rite of Spring – a riot-inducing ballet originally performed by the Ballet Russes. The original narrative circled around a sacrificial virgin dancing herself to death, appropriated aesthetically and thematically from Slavic folklore. In my version, the dancer awakens amidst ecological decline, drawing upon old-country aphorisms and the poetic structures of Strakh vylyvaty or pouring forth the fear, a Ukrainian healing technique to remedy anxieties, especially those related to land. In folklore globally, themes of dance, desire and death are repetitive. These connections are important for me, as I believe that folklore will survive amongst congregations not defined as culturally specific. Instead it can be enveloped by like-minded individuals interested in intersectional dialogue and education, envisioning spaces of transformation through perseverance and practice.

                            AYLA DMYTERKO is a Ukrainian-Canadian artist based in Glasgow originally from the Treaty Four lands of the Plains Cree, Dakota, Denesuline, Lakota, Métis, Michif, Nakota, Ojibwe and Saulteaux Indigenous Peoples. She reactivates cultural memory in response to epistemological injustices to locate sites of transformation. Oscillating between reverence and regeneration, she collaborates with the past to understand how it is continuously modified and re-iterated to shape our social psyche and conceptions of the future. Through auto-ethnographic impulses, she works across moving image, dance, painting, sculpture, textiles and text, echoing the porous and precarious nature of diasporic imagination.
