<I>Kill All Kings began as a radio show during the first summer of covid-19, bringing together the sounds that kept us going through isolation: a hybrid compilation of feminist folk horror, village voice, hard techno, spoken word and pop across distances and decades.
<br>Moving into programming artist moving image, we hold to our motivation of bringing new audiences to the work of artists who address the evolving worlds we live between with sincerity, humour and care.

<i>KAK Collective present a programme of audio and video in response to the idea of Ecstasy as a site of recalibration, altered states of consciousness and total involvement. <br>

Bodies and words dissolve through repetition, echoes of past movements resonate at the studio, through the air, on street corners and in the bath.

                                                        Baek collects visual energy and observes actions while reproducing invisible, visual energy into an image that exists in front of her. Now, people have become accustomed to a life of talking about a closed ‘space’ whose size can clearly be measured, rather than a landscape or a place. Moving from space to a space and confirming over and over again whether there is someone who may exist in it is the biggest proposition in which people currently judge a space. Does someone exist in a space? How many people are there? Is it sealed? The size of a space and the existence of someone who will occupy the inside – people don't think much about who the actual subject is rather than its existence and the importance of its existence. Ironically, just by staying where people are now, people express a tremendous presence and at the same time express a sense of extinction.

                                                        <br>Therefore, drawing such an invisible entity in a visible form would be an essential practice step to clearly recognising one's own form in a changing era (real space–virtual space). The artist experiences an era of aura’s extinction while simultaneously producing enormous data, traversing new bodies and data materials with images.

It is centered around the subject of an extinct genus of  deer, Megaloceros Giganteus, aka the ‘Irish’ Elk and departs from an experiment conducted in the 1980’s at the National Museum of Ireland where two zoologists mimicked a battle between this animal using a pair of their fossilized deer skulls to answer whether this animal could have used their oversized animals in battle. Rice works with two dancers to think through the problems of anthropomorphism, language and translation and complications surrounding ‘understanding’ the non-human.

Images of late-night rituals are sampled, remixed and fed-back; the semi-lucid bathing of two friends. Last song for a waterbaby is an articulation of both the joy and melancholy of an attempt to extend youth, an exploration of the 'stretched out adolescence’ described by queer theorist Jack Halberstam. The soundtrack was produced with musicians Cucina Povera and Sue Zuki at The Green Door Studio; a very loose cover of 'the last song'. It was originally shown in another formation at Collective Gallery Edinburgh.

Much of Shannon's practice pivots around live events; she collaboratively runs record label Domestic Exile, club night So Low alongside event series Daisies with France-lise McGurn and TLC.23 with Keira Fox. Upcoming projects include a live moving image performance with musician Cucina Povera for Sonica Glasgow and a solo presentation at Kunsthalle Ost Leipzig.

                                            <br><br> In this project we blend Fai’s cultural background and Mar’s sonic artistic practice to explore the experience of the failing human flesh vessel and the need for the spirit to transcend. We composed a soundscape that combines distorted voices and electronic sounds and effects to trigger the embodied experience of trance and surrender.

                                            <br> This audio piece is in relation to conjuring the presence of Allah. Using the 99 names that have a personal relation to Fai's background, we embark on a journey to explore a pleasurable experience of connecting together through the divine. Each of the 99 names embodies an attribute of the divine that the vessel requires to survive the extremities of this material plane.

                                            FAI & MAR are both artists currently based in the Netherlands. Coming from different backgrounds, their interests in performance art and activism brought them together. They intertwine their artistic practices to playfully explore different states of the body and expanded imagination through speech, sound, movement and memories. In their processes they dive together into the unknown, the in-between and the immaterial of the human experience.

Each year, half of all eligible children in the U.S and Canada wish to visit Disney World. My video Watch in Awe appropriates the theme parks’ aesthetic, humour, and performance-based strategies to dissect the complex relationship between wish fulfillment, illness, disability, and capitalist constructions of fantasy. It serves as a propaganda-esque introduction into this space.

A prevalent idea in the culture and branding of wish-granting agencies and GKTWV, positions happiness, and wish-fulfillment as a means to conquer illness. Disney fairy tale narratives are so embedded with hope, ever-present with a "happy ending." Likewise, Lauren Berlant theorizes the concept of cruel optimism as "the condition of maintaining an attachment to a significantly problematic object...the fear is that the loss of the promising object/ scene itself will defeat the capacity to have any hope about anything." This wish-granting format, and specifically the Disney wish, ask the wisher to maintain hope and attachment to capitalism, fairy tales and Disney, in order to maintain hope about anything at all. I appropriate and replicate performative strategies of positivity to point towards the hollowness of these acts.

                                  The small monitor contains a poem I pieced together drawing from a selection of Iraqi poets who write about concepts of exile, displacement, struggles of war, and dictatorship, and what it means to no longer belong to or reside in one’s nation and place of birth. This recitation re-appropriates and contextualizes Iraqi poetry in the form of a collage by using symbolism as a form of expression. The use of symbolic language is commonly found in Iraqi poetry as it demonstrates censorship under dictatorship regimes.

                                      AYAM YALDO is a Montréal/Tiohtiá:ke based artist and recent graduate from Concordia University in the department of Intermedia. Working in a wide range of media including performance, video, sound and sculpture, her work explores narratives that shift between the personal and the political, the past and present, reality and myth. Yaldo’s current research is concerned with the formation of identity and subjectivity, and how these take shape in relation to grand historical narratives, the European tradition of archeology, artifacts, and her personal experience of war and displacement from the Middle East as a child. Focusing on the body, identity and image, Yaldo explores concepts of world building through reconstruction, transformation and ephemerality, in relation to forms of displacement.

                              <BR>  <br>Sextra Curricular Activity is an experimental narrative that examines power, deviance, failure & desire through the lens of the absurd and surreal.

                      Storied depictions make way for ruptures- both celebratory and critical- debunking outmoded societal structures regarding race, class, gender and sexuality. Sound and vision simultaneously destabilize and ground the viewer as a way to enjoy the journey of transgressions of social mores. Stereotypes are reclaimed by a cast of characters that embrace the very biases that place them in the margins, allowing a plunge into alternate pasts, presents & futures that disregard power structures and embrace the authentic self.

                          <br>This film features family, their hands are present both physically and through their art. Much of the imagery in this film comes from beadwork from my maternal and paternal lineage. ​enn modeuz​includes skin stitching, harvesting quills, and sewing. All of these materials are in relation to adornment and by extension, our bodies. To wear these hand stitched items is to wear our identities. In times where the handmade is overlooked and traditions are seen as forgotten, taking the time to connect with our customs is a part of our revival.

                            <br>12 minutes

                            <br><BR><I>Rite of Return</i> is a moving image work that reflects on Marianne Hirsch’s generational return and post-memory introduced in Rites of Return whilst extending The Rite of Spring – a riot-inducing ballet originally performed by the Ballet Russes. The original narrative circled around a sacrificial virgin dancing herself to death, appropriated aesthetically and thematically from Slavic folklore. In my version, the dancer awakens amidst ecological decline, drawing upon old-country aphorisms and the poetic structures of Strakh vylyvaty or pouring forth the fear, a Ukrainian healing technique to remedy anxieties, especially those related to land. In folklore globally, themes of dance, desire and death are repetitive. These connections are important for me, as I believe that folklore will survive amongst congregations not defined as culturally specific. Instead it can be enveloped by like-minded individuals interested in intersectional dialogue and education, envisioning spaces of transformation through perseverance and practice.

                            AYLA DMYTERKO is a Ukrainian-Canadian artist based in Glasgow originally from the Treaty Four lands of the Plains Cree, Dakota, Denesuline, Lakota, Métis, Michif, Nakota, Ojibwe and Saulteaux Indigenous Peoples. She reactivates cultural memory in response to epistemological injustices to locate sites of transformation. Oscillating between reverence and regeneration, she collaborates with the past to understand how it is continuously modified and re-iterated to shape our social psyche and conceptions of the future. Through auto-ethnographic impulses, she works across moving image, dance, painting, sculpture, textiles and text, echoing the porous and precarious nature of diasporic imagination.
